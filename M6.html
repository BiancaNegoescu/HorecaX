                <h3>Blue sea or red sea?</h3>
                <p>Below, we can see some of the existing job applications on the market currently. If you do a Google search for a specific type of job, the websites listed below are the ones that will come to your aid with answers.</p>
                <p>At first glance, it is evident that we are navigating in red seas.</p>
                <img src="images/market_space.png" alt="Market space" width="600">

                <p>However, upon analyzing this market, we realized that there is currently no specific application dedicated to hiring in the HoReCa sector.</p>
                <p>All hiring platforms cover a variety of fields, which can make it difficult to navigate through jobs to find the desired one in this sector. This is also one of the reasons why entrepreneurs may not invest in advertisements on these platforms.</p>

                <p>Taking this aspect into account, is the water still so red? If we consider our specific field and add its specific requirements, do we still have many results? Not quite. So, do we have an blue sea?</p>
