                <p>Below, we had a conversation with a caf√© owner. Not only does he post job ads on eJobs and Facebook, but he also relies on hiring through acquaintances. The latter approach can come with its own set of issues. Often, when a friend recommends a potential employee, without a concrete and well-prepared CV, details about the experience of the potential employee become unclear.</p>

                <p>Below, we had a conversation with the owner of a pub in Constanta who is looking to hire people for the seasonal period. He uses alternative job sites such as eJobs. His difficulty lies in finding people to collaborate with and in whom he can trust for professionalism.</p>
