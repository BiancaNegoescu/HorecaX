        <h2>Problem we noticed...</h2>
        <p>In today's bustling event industry, the problem of understaffing has long affected event venues and businesses in the HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) sector. The demand for skilled and reliable hospitality professionals often surpasses the available workforce, leading to event organizers and businesses struggling to meet the service standards expected by their clients.

		Event planning and management should be a seamless experience for all involved, but the chronic shortage of qualified staff often leads to stress, service quality issues, and missed business opportunities. Event venues and HoReCa establishments find themselves in a constant struggle to find temporary or permanent staff on short notice, resulting in added operational costs and lost revenue potential.

	<h2>
		Why HorecaX?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Compared with the possible competition listed above, HorecaX is <strong>focused on horeca sector</strong>, which the other platforms just address to. Both hipo.ro and eJobs.ro include job listings for positions within the HoReCa sector, but they are not mainly focused on it, thus the amount of job searching results is not great. As a result, users have to search on multiple platforms to gather a decent number of jobs. This time consuming activities could be avoided by searching exclusively on HorecaX, which displays only horeca jobs!
		Moreover, Tura9 is focused on offering one-day jobs, while HorecaX has a wide variety of job types: permanent, temporary and seasonal.
		HorecaX stands out by being horeca sector focused and offering jobs varied in duration.
