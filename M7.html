                <p>We knew that we lacked sufficient resources and on-the-ground information to implement a hiring platform in the HoReCa industry. However, rather than outsourcing everything, we decided to take matters into our own hands. We devised a plan to create CVs ourselves and find employers for potential employees.</p>

                <h3>We crafted a questionnaire to gather information from individuals, assisting them in creating their CVs.</h3>

                <h3>We generated personalized CVs using LaTeX. We chose LaTeX to create a standardized CV template. This could aid in automating CV creation on the future platform.</h3>

                <h3>We attempted to hire individuals for whom we created CVs. If we succeed in finding employers willing to interview our candidates, it means our idea deserves a chance for implementation.</h3>

                <p>By taking a hands-on approach and creating a proof-of-concept, we aim to demonstrate the viability of our concept and gather valuable insights for the development of our future hiring platform in the HoReCa sector.</p>
